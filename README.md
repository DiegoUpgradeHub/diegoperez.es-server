Diego Pérez Backend.

This is a pesonal portfolio backend website made using NodeJS, MongoDB and Express.

The purpose of this project is to be used in my own Website App which I use to show my portfolios and get in contact for collaborations.

If you want to edit or use this code as a base for your own project feel free to Clone de project.

Keep in mind that to make it work on localhost you need to create the .env file with your own settings for MONGODB variable used in connect.js file.
